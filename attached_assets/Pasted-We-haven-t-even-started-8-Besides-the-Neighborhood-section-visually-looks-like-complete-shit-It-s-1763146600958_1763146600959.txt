We haven't even started #8. Besides the Neighborhood section visually looks like complete shit. It's all jumbled and looks like a 5 year old constructed it. How do we fix that before even moving onto Task #8

That is a completely fair and honest assessment. User experience (UX) and visual quality are paramount, and if the basic structure looks "jumbled," it needs to be fixed immediately before adding more complexity like the Senior Score (Task #8) or the Budget Engine (Task #6).

The jumbled look you're seeing is almost always a CSS layout issue, often caused by unstyled or improperly contained elements in a single-page HTML file.

The best way to fix this, given that your environment seems to be a mix of the original single-page HTML and modern React components (like the StreetView component you shared), is to ensure the CSS grid/flex container holding the content is properly defined.

Since you've moved to a modern stack (React/Vite), we should leverage the power of CSS classes to properly structure the layout for the Neighborhood section.

🎨 Fixing the Jumbled Neighborhood Layout
Since you provided a React component previously, I will provide the structural CSS needed, assuming you are using standard CSS or a utility framework like Tailwind (as suggested by classes like Card, Button, etc.).

Step 1: Define a Layout Container in CSS
This CSS will create a consistent 2-column grid for your city features, which is usually the source of the "jumbled" look.

In your main CSS file (or within a <style> block if you are still using the single HTML file), add these styles.

CSS
/* --- New Styles for Task #5 & #8 Layout --- */

/* The main container for all features (Street View, Budget, Senior Score) */
.feature-grid-container {
    display: grid;
    /* On small screens, use 1 column. On larger screens (768px+), use 2 columns. */
    grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Default: one column */
    gap: 30px; /* Space between the cards */
    padding: 20px;
    max-width: 1200px; /* Limits the max width for better readability */
    margin: 40px auto; /* Centers the container */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .feature-grid-container {
        /* Two equal columns for desktop/tablet */
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; 
    }
}

/* Ensure all card-like elements fit snugly */
.card-like-element {
    /* Optional: ensures background color is uniform */
    background-color: #1a1a1a; 
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 25px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
Step 2: Apply the Container to the City Detail View
Now, wrap the various feature components—the Street View (Task #5), the Budget Engine (Task #6), and the planned Senior Score (Task #8)—in this new grid container within your city detail view (e.g., your Puerto Vallarta modal).

Assuming you have a main component for each city, the structure should look like this:

HTML
<section class="city-detail-page">
    <h1>Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco</h1>

    <div class="feature-grid-container">

        <div class="card-like-element">
            <StreetView 
                lat={20.609420} 
                lng={-105.232304} 
                title="Romantic Zone"
            />
        </div>

        <div class="card-like-element">
            <BudgetEngine cityId="pv" cityName="Puerto Vallarta" />

            <div id="senior-mode-pv" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <h3>Senior Comfort Score (Task #8)</h3>
                <button onclick="getSeniorScore('Puerto Vallarta')">
                    Get Senior Score
                </button>
                <div id="pv-senior-result" class="score-display"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="full-width-content">
        </div>
</section>
By adding the feature-grid-container with the CSS in Step 1, you force the Street View and the Budget Engine to sit neatly side-by-side on larger screens, eliminating the "jumbled" look and giving your portal a professional, organized structure.

Once you implement this structure, the jumbled appearance should be gone, and we can proceed to finalize the Budget Math Engine (Task #6), which was our last instruction.

Are you able to implement this CSS structure and verify the cleaner two-column layout in your Replit project?
