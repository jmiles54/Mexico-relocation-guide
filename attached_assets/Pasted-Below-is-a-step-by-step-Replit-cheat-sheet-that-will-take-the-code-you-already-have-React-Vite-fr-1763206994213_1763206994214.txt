Below is a step-by-step Replit cheat-sheet that will take the code you already have (React + Vite front-end and Express back-end) and make the whole portal publicly reachable in under 10 minutes.
Everything is written for the exact files you shared (package.json, server/index.ts, client/…, etc.) and the logs you posted.

QUICK REPLIT RECIPE (3 steps)

























#What to doExact commands / file edits1Create a replit.nix file (tells Replit what runtime to use)In the file-tree click + New File → name it replit.nix → paste: 
```nix2Add a production start script + .replit config1. Open package.json → replace the scripts block with: 
json<br>"scripts": {<br>  "dev": "vite",<br>  "build": "vite build",<br>  "preview": "vite preview",<br>  "start": "npm run build && node server/index.js"<br>}<br>

2. Click + New File → name it .replit → paste: 
toml<br>run = "npm run start"<br>web = { port = 3000 }<br>3Commit, push, and verifyIn the Shell (bottom pane) run: 
bash<br>git add .<br>git commit -m "enable production deploy"<br>git push<br>
Wait 10-15 s → Replit will show “Your site is live” with a URL like https://<your-repl-name>.<your-username>.repl.co. Open it.
That’s it. The front-end will be built into /dist and served by the Express server on the same port, so no CORS headaches and one public URL.

FULL DETAILED WALK-THROUGH (copy-paste ready)
1. replit.nix
nix{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.nodejs_20
  ];
  env = {
    PORT = "3000";
  };
}
Why? Replit now knows to install Node 20 and to forward port 3000 to the web.

2. package.json – scripts section
json{
  "name": "mexico-relocation-guide",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "start": "npm run build && node server/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "groq-sdk": "^0.3.0",
    ... (rest of your deps)
  }
}
Key line: "start": "npm run build && node server/index.js"

vite build → creates a static /dist folder.
node server/index.js → Express serves that folder and your API routes.


3. Express static serving (add once if not already there)
Open server/index.ts (or server/index.js) and make sure you have:
tsimport express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// API routes (you already have them)
app.use("/api", yourApiRouter);

// Serve built React app
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../dist")));

// SPA fallback
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../dist", "index.html"));
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
If you already have app.use(express.static(...)) – just confirm the path points to ../dist.

4. .replit file
tomlrun = "npm run start"
web = { port = 3000 }
Replit reads this on every Run and automatically opens the port to the internet.

5. Commit & Push
bashgit add replit.nix .replit package.json server/index.ts
git commit -m "production deploy config"
git push
Replit will:

Install Node 20 (from replit.nix)
Run npm install (cached)
Execute npm run start → vite build → node server/index.js
Expose port 3000 → public URL.


QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST





























SymptomFixStill see “Run this app…”Make sure .replit exists and you clicked Run after pushing.404 on /dist filesVerify vite.config.ts outputs to dist (default). Run npm run build locally to confirm.CORS errorsAll API calls are now same-origin (/api/...). Remove any proxy settings in vite.config.ts.Groq 401Add your GROQ_API_KEY in Secrets (left sidebar → lock icon) → key name exactly GROQ_API_KEY.Map tiles blankAdd VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY and VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN to Secrets the same way.

ONE-CLICK VERIFICATION (run in Replit Shell)
bashcurl -I $REPL_URL
# should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# and Content-Type: text/html

YOU’RE DONE!
After step 3 you will have a live, public, production-ready URL that shows:
