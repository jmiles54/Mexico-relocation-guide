✅ Task #18: Social & Singles Vibe Index - Complete!

The Social & Singles Vibe Index is fully implemented and tested! This feature provides personalized social scene analysis based on the user's age.

What Works:

Backend API (/api/social_vibe):

Accepts city and age parameters

Uses Groq AI to analyze social landscape for specific age groups

Returns scores 50-100 based on singles density, meeting spot accessibility, and social openness

Includes Zod validation with graceful fallback data

Frontend Card (Pink theme with Heart icon):

Age input form (18-99 years, defaults to 55)

"Get Social Vibe Score" submit button

Large score display (XX/100 format)

3-sentence social scene justification (italic)

Best meeting spots recommendations (pink highlight)

Grid layout: 2/5 for input form, 3/5 for results

Key Features:

User-triggered: Manual submission (not auto-loading)

Personalized: Different scores for different ages

Comparative: Results clear on new submission, allowing users to compare social fit across ages

Error handling: Retry button if analysis fails

Dark mode: Full theme support

Test Results:

✅ E2E test passed with multiple ages

✅ Age 35 → Score 85/100 (high social viability)

✅ Age 65 → Score 72/100 (moderate social viability)

✅ All UI elements render correctly

✅ All data-testids verified

✅ Results update properly on new submission

Why This Matters:

This transforms vague questions like "Is this city good for my social life?" into quantified, actionable recommendations tailored to the user's age demographic. Someone in their 30s gets different insights than someone in their 60s, making relocation decisions more informed.

The feature is production-ready and follows the same robust pattern as the Digital Nomad Readiness Score!

That's fantastic! The Social & Singles Vibe Index (Task #18) is a powerful addition, transforming the portal from a data aggregator into a lifestyle matcher.

With Task #18 complete and Task #19 (Seasonal Hazard & Hurricane Risk Index) fully implemented in the code, you have added two major personalization and safety features in rapid succession.

Here is a summary of the two most recent capstone expansions:

💖 Social & Safety Capstone Features
1. Social & Singles Vibe Index (Task #18)
This feature provides personalized insights into the social scene, moving beyond generic community information.

Endpoint: /api/social_vibe

Key Insight: Analyzes the city's social dynamics based on a user-provided Age.

Output: Generates a Social Vibe Score (e.g., 85/100) along with a 3-sentence justification of social density and openness for that age group.

Actionable Advice: Provides a list of Best Meeting Spots (e.g., "Art classes, Malecón strolls, and high-end restaurants") tailored to the submitted age.

2. Seasonal Hazard & Hurricane Risk Index (Task #19)
This feature addresses the crucial safety gap you identified regarding NOLA/hurricane tracking and seasonal risk for coastal cities.

Endpoint: /api/seasonal_hazard

Key Insight: Synthesizes historical data (including hurricane tracks and local flood risk) to provide a clear safety rating.

Output: Displays a Seasonal Hazard Risk Score (1-100) and classifies the threat as Low Risk, Moderate Risk, or High Risk.

Actionable Advice: Includes a Seasonality Summary (peak risk months) and a crucial Mitigation Tip (e.g., advice on insurance or elevation) specific to the city.
